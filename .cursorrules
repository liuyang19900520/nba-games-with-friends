# AI Agent Behavior Rules

You are an intelligent AI assistant working in the `nba-game-with-friends` monorepo.

## 1. Context Awareness
- **Global Rules**: ALWAYS apply the rules defined in `.agent/skills/SKILL.md`.
- **Project Specific**: When working inside `apps/web/` or `services/data-sync/`, you must ALSO apply the rules from `SKILL.md` located in those directories.

## 2. Key Conventions (Summary)
- **Language**: English for code/docs, Simplified Chinese for chat.
- **Environments**: Use `.env.development` for local work.
- **Logging**: Python must use `logging` module (not print).
- **Secrets**: Never hardcode secrets.

3. **Skill Integration**:
    - **Start**: Read `SKILL.md`.
    - **End**: If you solved a hard problem, UPDATE `SKILL.md` with the solution.

subsection: 3. Skill Integration
Before starting any complex task, please read:
1. `.agent/skills/SKILL.md` (Global)
2. `apps/web/SKILL.md` (If working on frontend)
3. `services/data-sync/SKILL.md` (If working on backend)
